# OpenGL studies

This files is a compilation of my studies of old style OpengL.

All this project is made with GLUT. I know GLUT is not the best library for manage window, but this is only for studies.

Only two files use the 'new OpenGL style', they are just a sketch. They were not made with the best optimization. I'm still studying.

>I just tested the codes on Linux

## Compile

- To compile this code use ```-lGL -lGLU -lglut``` flags.

I hope some of these files can help in your studies.


I used [OpenGL SuperBible Fourth Edition](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321498828/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321498828&linkCode=as2&tag=opsu-20) to learn.
